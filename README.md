 Project Description
Our project objective is to successfully install Linux distributions on two different generations of android cellphones. Our aim is not only to see if it’s possible to make it work on older generations as well as newer generations, but also to track our progress and upload a YouTube video of our successful steps.
Platform of choice
We will be using our desktop computers to work on these cellphones : -Samsung Galaxy a70.
-Samsung Galaxy S3.
Demonstration Plan
We most likely will record a YouTube tutorial, with our voice over to explain everything. If everything goes well, it will be uploaded and demonstrated in front of the class.
Requirements
We need to pin down our distributions of choice, so far our ideas are : Ubuntu Touch, NixOS, Mobian, Nemo Mobile, PostMarketOS.
We are developing a contribution-geared project.
Solutions Compared
Our contribution will be to spread our knowledge so that the people looking into this, can use our help to finish their own projects. We will be comparing how different generations of devices handle the chosen distributions, if possible on the older model, and guide the viewer through our steps.

   Week 1
Timeline
- Wipe and clean the phones that will be used and make sure they are working correctly.
- Research the difference between the distributions initially found, and determine the better one for
each device.
- Research all the steps needed to install the chosen distributions, mark down possible issues that could
be encountered during the procedure. - (Document our findings clearly.)
Week 2
- Finalize all our research and steps.
- Set up our instructions for the video (the steps we will follow during filming). - Film the tutorial for the older device.
Week 3
- Film the tutorial for the newer device.
- Edit the video.
- After updating all documents, publish contents. - Present to classmates.
